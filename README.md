## About The App
Andr3wdowns Trivia Game is a simple trivia game using the OpenDB Trivia API. Players can choose from 4 randomly picked categories before every round. Choosing the correct answer gives the player 1 point and there are 10 rounds in total. The scores are then saved in localstorage and can be viewed on the scores menu.
